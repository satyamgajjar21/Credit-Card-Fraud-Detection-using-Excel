Project Overview
Credit card fraud often involves the unauthorized use of stolen credentials for online purchases. This project uses Excelâ€™s powerful data analysis features to explore transaction data, identify anomalies, and uncover insights into fraudulent behavior.

Key Steps in the Project
Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Identifying and correcting missing or inconsistent data.
Standardizing formats (e.g., dates) for accurate analysis.
Pattern and Anomaly Detection:

Using Excel formulas and conditional formatting to highlight anomalies.
Identifying patterns such as unusual transaction frequency, high-value purchases, and mismatched delivery details.
Visualization:

Leveraging Excel charts (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, and pivot charts) to present trends and anomalies effectively.
Common Indicators of Fraudulent Transactions
Sudden spikes in transaction frequency.
Transactions significantly higher than the user's average.
Bulk purchases of similar items with minor variations.
Delivery address changes to unusual locations (e.g., PO Boxes).
IP addresses inconsistent with billing addresses.
